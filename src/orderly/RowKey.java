/** Base class for translating objects to/from sort-order preserving byte 
 * arrays. 
 *
 * <p>In contrast to other common object serialization methods, 
 * <code>RowKey</code> serializations use a byte array representation that 
 * preserves the object's natural sort ordering. Sorting the raw byte arrays 
 * yields the same sort order as sorting the actual objects themselves, without 
 * requiring the object to be instantiated. Using the serialized byte arrays 
 * as row keys in key-value stores such as HBase will sort rows in the natural 
 * sort order of the object.</p>
 *
 * <h1> Key types </h1>
 * Primitive (single-value) key types are: variable-length signed/unsigned 
 * integers and longs, fixed-width signed/unsigned integers and longs, 
 * float/double, bigdecimal, and utf-8/text/String character strings.
 *
 * <p>Composite (multi-value) row key support is provided using struct row keys.
 * You may have an arbitrary number of fields of any type, and each field
 * may have its own sort order.</p>
 *
 * <h1> Order </h1>
 * All keys may be sorted in ascending or descending order.
 *
 * <h1> NULL </h1>
 * Most keys support NULL values (only fixed-width integer/long types do not). 
 * All keys with NULL support treat the NULL value as comparing less than any
 * non-NULL value for sort ordering purposes.
 *
 * <h1> Termination </h1>
 * Some row keys, such as character strings, require an explicit termination
 * byte during serialization to indicate the end of the serialized value.
 * This terminator byte can be omitted in some situations, such as during an
 * ascending sort where the only serialized bytes come from the string row key.
 * Omitting the explicit terminator byte is known as implicit termination, 
 * because the end of the serialized byte array implicitly terminates the 
 * serialized value. The {@link #setTermination} method can be used to
 * control when termination is required.
 *
 * <p>If a row key is not forced to terminate, then during deserialization it
 * will read bytes up until the end of the serialized byte array. This is safe
 * if the row key serialized all of the bytes up to the end of the byte array
 * (which is the common case). However, if the user has created a custom 
 * serialized format where their own extra bytes are appended to the byte array,
 * then this would produce incorrect results and explicit termination should
 * be forced.</p>
 *
 * <p>The JavaDoc of each
 * row key class describes the effects of implicit and explicit termination
 * of the class's serialization. Note that the <code>termination</code> flag
 * only affects serialization. For all row key types, deserialization and skip 
 * methods are able to detect values encoded in both implicit and explicit 
 * terminated formats, regardless of what the <code>termination</code> flag
 * is set to.</p>
