/** Serializes and deserializes DoubleWritables into a sortable byte aray 
 * representation.
 *
 * <p>This format ensures the following total ordering of floating point values:
 * NULL &lt; Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY &lt; -Double.MAX_VALUE &lt; ... 
 * &lt; -Double.MIN_VALUE &lt; -0.0 &lt; +0.0; &lt; Double.MIN_VALUE &lt; ...
 * &lt; Double.MAX_VALUE &lt; Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY &lt; Double.NaN</p>
 *
 * <h1>Serialization Format</h1>
 * <p>Floating point numbers are encoded as specified in IEEE 754. A 64-bit double 
 * precision float consists of a sign bit, 11-bit unsigned exponent encoded 
 * in offset-1023 notation, and a 52-bit significand. The format is described
 * further in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_precision">
 * Double Precision Floating Point Wikipedia page</a></p>
 *
 * <p>The value of a normal float is 
 * -1 <sup>sign bit</sup> &times; 2<sup>exponent - 1023</sup>
 * &times; 1.significand</p>
 *
 * <p>The IEE754 floating point format already preserves sort ordering 
 * for positive floating point numbers when the raw bytes are compared in 
 * most significant byte order. This is discussed further at 
 * <a href="http://www.cygnus-software.com/papers/comparingfloats/comparingfloats.htm">
 * http://www.cygnus-software.com/papers/comparingfloats/comparingfloats.htm</a>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>Thus, we need only ensure that negative numbers sort in the the exact 
 * opposite order as positive numbers (so that say, negative infinity is less 
 * than negative 1), and that all negative numbers compare less than any 
 * positive number. To accomplish this, we invert the sign bit of all floating 
 * point numbers, and we also invert the exponent and significand bits if the 
 * floating point number was negative.</p>
 *
 * <p>More specifically, we first store the floating point bits into a 64-bit 
 * long <code>l</code> using {@link Double#doubleToLongBits}. This method 
 * collapses all NaNs into a single, canonical NaN value but otherwise leaves 
 * the bits unchanged. We then compute</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * l ^= (l &gt;&gt; (Long.SIZE - 1)) | Long.MIN_SIZE
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>which inverts the sign bit and XOR's all other bits with the sign bit 
 * itself. Comparing the raw bytes of <code>l</code> in most significant byte 
 * order is equivalent to performing a double precision floating point 
 * comparison on the underlying bits (ignoring NaN comparisons, as NaNs don't 
 * compare equal to anything when performing floating point comparisons).</p>
 *
 * <p>Finally, we must encode NULL efficiently. Fortunately, <code>l</code> can 
 * never have all of its bits set to one (equivalent to -1 signed in two's 
 * complement) as this value corresponds to a NaN removed during NaN 
 * canonicalization. Thus, we can encode NULL as a long zero, and all non-NULL 
 * numbers are translated to a long as specified above and then incremented by 
 * 1, which is guaranteed not to cause unsigned overflow as <code>l</code> must
 * have at least one bit set to zero.</p>
 *
 * <p>The resulting long integer is then converted into a byte array by 
 * serializing the long one byte at a time in most significant byte order.
 * All serialized values are 8 bytes in length</p>
 *
 * <h1> Descending sort </h1>
 * To sort in descending order we perform the same encodings as in ascending 
 * sort, except we logically invert (take the 1's complement of) each byte. 
 *
 * <h1> Implicit Termination </h1>
 * If {@link #termination} is false and the sort order is ascending, we can
 * encode NULL values as a zero-length byte array instead of using the 8 byte 
 * encoding specified above. Implicit termination is discussed further in 
 * {@link RowKey}.
 *
 * <h1> Usage </h1>
 * This is the fastest class for storing doubles. It performs no object copies
 * during serialization and deserialization.
