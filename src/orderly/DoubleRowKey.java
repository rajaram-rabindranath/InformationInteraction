/** Serializes and deserializes Doubles into a sortable byte aray 
 * representation.
 * 
 * <p>The serialization and deserialization method are identical to 
 * {@link DoubleWritableRowKey} after converting the DoubleWritable to/from a 
 * Double.</p>
 *
 * <h1> Usage </h1>
 * This is the slower class for storing doubles. No copies are made when 
 * serializing and deserializing, but unfortunately Double objects are 
 * immutable and thus cannot be re-used across multiple deserializations.
 * However, deserialized primitive doubles are first passed to 
 * {@link Double#valueOf}, so boxed Double values may be shared if the 
 * <code>valueOf</code> method has frequent cache hits.
